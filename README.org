* Ithkuil dictionary
This project consists of a scraper to extract and organize lexicon information and a simple page to display and search it.
* Scraper
The [[file:literate/scraper_modules.org][Scraper ]]runs against the following files to assemble an almost complete lexicon of Ithkuil roots:
- [[file:./scraper/data/lexicon.html][The Lexicon]]
- [[file:./scraper/data/lexicon_supplement_1.html][The Lexicon Supplement]]
* Dictionary
The dictionary currently displays most of the roots from the original lexicon page.
A new page is in progress with some updated styling.
